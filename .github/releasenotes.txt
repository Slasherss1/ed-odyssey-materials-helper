**What file should you download?**
If you are on Windows, you can install the auto updater msi file
If you are on Linux, you can install the auto updater deb or rpm file. If you are on an unsupported linux distro, you can download the portable autoupdater zip file.

The auto updaters will check for a new version on launch.
The portable zip versions are used as update packages. You can run them standalone, but they are no longer truly portable as settings are stored on the local machine.

Fix capi deserialization issue
Add CG power distributor modules
Add option to colonisation projects to exclude them from the all projects overview
Fixed a bug in the menu where materials could show wrong quantity and color
